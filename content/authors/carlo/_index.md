#Dr. Carlo Fischione is a Full Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Division of Network and Systems Engineering, Stockholm, Sweden.
#He received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Information Engineering (3/3 years) in May 2005 from University of L’Aquila, Italy, and the Laurea degree in Electronic Engineering (Laurea, Summa cum Laude, 5/5 years) in April 2001 from the same University.
#He has held research positions at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA (2015, Visiting Professor); Harvard University, Cambridge, MA (2015, Associate); and University of California at Berkeley, CA (2004-2005, Visiting Scholar, and 2007-2008, Research Associate).
#His research interests include optimization with applications to networks, wireless and sensor networks, Internet of Things, and digital systems. He has co-authored over 180 publications, including a book, book chapters, international journals and conferences, and international patents.
#He received or co-received a number of awards, such as the “IEEE Communication Society S. O. Rice” best paper award of 2018 for the best IEEE Transactions on Communications paper, the best paper award of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics (2007),
#the best paper awards at the IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor System 05 and 09 (IEEE MASS 2005 and IEEE MASS 2009), the Best Paper Award of the IEEE Sweden VT-COM-IT Chapter (2014), the Best Business Idea awards from VentureCup East Sweden (2010)
#and from Stockholm Innovation and Growth (STING) Life Science in Sweden (2014), the “Ferdinando Filauro” award from University of L’Aquila, Italy (2003), the “Higher Education” award from Abruzzo Region Government, Italy (2004),
#the Junior Research award from Swedish Research Council (2007), the “Silver Ear of Wheat” award in history from the Municipality of Tornimparte, Italy (2012). He is Editor of IEEE Transactions on Communications and Associated Editor of IFAC Automatica. Meanwhile,
#he also has offered his advice as a consultant to numerous technology companies such as ABB Corporate Research, Berkeley Wireless Sensor Network Lab, Ericsson Research, Synopsys, and United Technology Research Center. He is co-founder and Scientific Director of MIND Music Labs.
#He is Member of IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers), and Ordinary Member of DASP (the Italian academy of history Deputazione Abruzzese di Storia Patria).

#In recent years, thousands of researchers and practitioners in both industry and academia have pushed the boundaries of the possible.
#Machine learning and Internet of Things, along with the umbrella term digitalization, have emerged as golden standards for the future
#of society. We have now reached a point where machines are able to help us in our daily lives, and the smart society of the future is
#right around the corner.
#
#Still, the combined potential of Internet of Things and Machine Learning has been scarcely utilized. In the past few years, more data
#has been generated than in the history of mankind combined, much due to Internet of Things applications. Due to issues with ownership
#and privacy, and the distributed nature of Internet of Things itself, conventional Machine Learning methods are not suitable to these
#applications.
#
#To tackle these questions, we have put together a research group with expertise in wireless networks, digital systems, control theory,
#and optimization. Together with industry partners and public sector, we are also working to bring these breakthroughs into applications.
